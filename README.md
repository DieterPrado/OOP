### General info

In the OOP course I learned the basics of OOP, especially analyzing objects and abstracting information from them so that classes with attributes and behaviors can be generated. In the course I worked with 4 programming languages which were Java, Javascript, Php and Python. I learned the basic structure in the 4 languages to create classes and create objects with behaviors based on those classes. Inside the folders of this repository there are the same files but written in each language. The files that served as super classes were Account, Payment and Car while the rest of the files inherit from these classes depending on the business logic. For example, UberX inherits from Car while User inherits from Account.
